		<h1>Fire Ants II</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the world of <strong>"Fire Ants"</strong>! In the year 2013, a colony of mechanized fire ants located in <em>Kilgore, Texas</em> were exterminated by an unknown hero, just microseconds before the launch of their militaristic global takeover. Today, thousands of people enter the abandoned anthill in hopes of finding the lost 1.2 <em>zillion</em> dollars in the treasury of the Fire Ants. Do you have what it takes to find the 1.2 <em>zillion</em> dollars?
